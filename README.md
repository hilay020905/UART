# UART Communication System (Verilog)

This project implements a **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter)** communication system in Verilog HDL.  
UART is a widely used protocol for **serial communication** between digital devices such as FPGAs, microcontrollers, and PCs.

## üìñ Project Overview

The project implements a UART communication system with the following components:

- **UART Frame Format** (`IMAGES/FIG01.jpg`)  
  The UART frame consists of:
  - Start bit (Low)
  - 8 Data bits (`D0`‚Äì`D7`)
  - Optional parity bit
  - Stop bit (High)  

  This defines the structure of each data transmission.

- **Device Connection** (`IMAGES/FIG02.jpg`)  
  Two devices (Device 01 and Device 02) are connected with **crossed TX/RX lines** (TX of one to RX of the other) and a **shared ground**, which is typical for UART communication.

- **Transmitter Architecture** (`IMAGES/FIG03.jpg`)  
  Includes:
  - **Baud Rate Generator** ‚Üí produces the clock signal  
  - **Parity Generator** ‚Üí generates parity bit (optional)  
  - **Finite State Machine (FSM)** ‚Üí controls transmission sequence  
  - **Parallel-in Serial-out (PISO) Register** ‚Üí shifts parallel data out serially

- **Receiver Architecture** (`IMAGES/FIG04.jpg`)  
  Includes:
  - **Baud Rate Generator** ‚Üí synchronizes receiver sampling  
  - **Negative Edge Detector** ‚Üí identifies start bit  
  - **Finite State Machine (FSM)** ‚Üí manages reception sequence  
  - **Parity Checker** ‚Üí validates received data  
  - **Serial-in Parallel-out (SIPO) Register** ‚Üí converts serial input back to parallel data
